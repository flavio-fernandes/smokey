# Overview

Package logger is a goroutine-safe logging facility which  writes logs with different severity levels to files, console, or both. Logs with different severity levels are written to different logfiles.

# Features

1. Auto rotation: It'll create a new logfile whenever day changes or size of the current logfile exceeds the configured size limit.
2. Auto purging: It'll delete some oldest logfiles whenever the number of logfiles exceeds the configured limit.
3. Log-through: Logs with higher severity level will be written to all the logfiles with lower severity level.
4. Log levels: 6 different levels are supported. Logs with different levels are written to different logfiles. By setting the Logger object to a higher log level, lower level logs will be filtered out.
5. Logs are not buffered, they are written to logfiles immediately with os.(*File).Write().
6. It'll create symlinks that link to the most current logfiles.

# Basic examples

## Use the global Logger object
	// logger.Init must be called first to create the global Logger object
	err := logger.Init(&logger.Config{
    	LogDir:          "./logs",
    	LogFileMaxSize:  200,
    	LogFileMaxNum:   500,
    	LogFileNumToDel: 50,
    	LogLevel:        logger.LogLevelInfo,
    	LogDest:         logger.LogDestFile,
    	Flag:            logger.ControlFlagLogLineNum,
    })
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
	logger.Infof("Failed to find player! uid=%d plid=%d cmd=%s xxx=%d", 1234, 678942, "getplayer", 102020101)
	logger.Warnf("Failed to parse protocol! uid=%d plid=%d cmd=%s", 1234, 678942, "getplayer")

## Create a new Logger object

While the global Logger object should be enough for most cases, you can also create as many Logger objects as desired.

    newLogger, err := logger.New(&logger.Config{
    	LogDir:          "./logs",
    	LogFileMaxSize:  200,
    	LogFileMaxNum:   500,
    	LogFileNumToDel: 50,
    	LogLevel:        logger.LogLevelInfo,
    	LogDest:         logger.LogDestFile,
    	Flag:            logger.ControlFlagLogLineNum,
    })
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
	newLogger.Info("abc", 123, 444.77)
	newLogger.Error("abc", 123, 444.77)
	newLogger.Close()
